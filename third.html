						<h1 class="a">*My Short Back Story*</h1>
						<br /><br />
						<br /><br />
						<h1 class="b"> I started to study at school when I’m 4 years old. I graduated from Kinder garden at gwadal canal kinder garden. I graduated in Elementary school at the age of 10 year old in San Juan elementary school. At this point I started to work before I goto school. Every morning I goto Lola Pining house to care take her Elder Brother I wash him, I put cloth on him, I cook food for him after that he will give me money 50 pesos and goto school, after school Everyday I always walk to save money for my project even though it's so far, when I got home I will going to supermarket to buy ingredients for our food stall, we sale kwek-kwek, fishball, kikiam, lumpia, etc. Yes it's tiring but we don't have a choice because we are poor, many year past many challenges & changes comes but still my family remain still strongly together. fast forward I graduated in Junior high school in Maceda Integrated School. And I graduated in Senior High school on Divine Grace Montessori Rosales Pang. And currently a College student in Urdaneta City University. 
						
						I will say that I m the one who has big dream. I always trying my best to reach and to achieve my goals and dreams. But sometimes my lazyness always try to destroy my spirit and motivation. One of my weakness is I am not a person got a self confidence and also my family, I’m very shy in front of many people it’s makes me so nervous. Do I decided to show my inspirational thoughts through the words. 
        
         I’m afraid what people say to me, and I’m afraid to be judge by doing wrong that’s why I’m shy of everything. When I was I little child, I always say to my parents that when I grow up I will going to be a successful son, I want to makes my parents, siblings to be happy I want to provide there needs and wants, I’m sure I can say that I’m smart but not totally smart,  I’m friendly, and I’m a creative boy. I always do something that I want and I try new things something different in order to grow and learn more. I always try to gave my best to myself and to my parents. I hope everything  that I want I wish  will achieved and granted to me in the near future. 
         
          My parents is my inspiration I want to pay there struggles there sacrifice in order for us there children to live,  I thanks God for giving me this wonderful parents I promise myself that I will build the best of me in order to be successful and for my parents to be proud of.
